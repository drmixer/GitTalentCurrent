              We started GitTalent because hiring devs should not be about buzzwords and resumes. It should be about work â€“ real code, real projects, real proof.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
              We believe developers deserve to be discovered for what they actually do, not how they talk about it. And recruiters deserve better tools to surface great talent faster.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
              GitTalent connects both sides through a transparent, AI-assisted hiring experience built on GitHub activity, not fluff.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              We are just getting started. Join us while we grow and help shape the future of developer hiring.
