Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of createUserProfileFromAuth function:
  };

// At the end of the AuthProvider component:
};

// At the end of the file:
```

The file was missing two closing curly braces - one to close the `createUserProfileFromAuth` function and another to close the `AuthProvider` component. I've added them in the appropriate places while maintaining all the existing code structure and functionality.
